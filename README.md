# Netflix-Admin

## ⭐ Welcome to the Netflix-Admin!

Netflix Admin is an admin panel for netflix which almost matches the offical Netflix UI. It is a work in progress and is not yet complete. Main Purpose of this project is to use this in my netflix project which is still in development.

Feel free to contribute to this project by creating issues and pull requests.

Any kind of contribution will be appreciated.

## 📌 Technonologies used

This project is built using ReactJS. Most interesting part of this project is data visualization which will be done either using D3.js or using some other library like echarts or chartjs. I am also considering Recharts for the same because of its high usage and popularity from past few months.

## 🚀 API and Backend

For the time being, backend code for this project is not public. It is written in NodeJS and express. I will be using MongoDB for the database. Making it a complete MERN stack application. Free feel to contribute to backend part of this project by using your own backend code for testing purposes.
